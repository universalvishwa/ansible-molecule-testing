# Ansible Molecule Testing
Example for Ansible role testing with Molecule, Testinfra and Linters.

## Overview
- This repository contains details on how to test an Ansible role using over a number of aspects,
    - sdfsd
    - sdfsdf
    - sdfdsfwe
    - sdfsdfsd
    - sdfsdfsd
    - sdfsdsv
- Most of the Ansible role testing functionality is converged around the `Molecule` tool.
- `Molecule` is designed to automate all parts of Ansible role testing.


##### Molecule Setup
- In this example, we are using `docker` driver as it closely resembles many practical scenarios of VMs of Cloud computer offerings.
- [Optional] Molecule testing can be executed inside a Python *Virtual environment*. When doing so, install the `molecule-docker` package.
    ```bash
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
    $ python3 -m pip install molecule-docker
    ```
- Pre-requisites:
    - Docker >=19.03 (`docker info`)
    - Python >=3.6 (`python --version`)
    - ansible >=2.8 (`ansible --version`)
    - molecule >=3.2 (`molecule --version`)
- Python package requirements are included in _requirements.txt_. Installing pre-requisites,
    ```bash
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
    ```

## Step-by-Step instructions
1. Initialize a new role with Molecule
    - Can create a new Ansible role using Molecule, _**OR**_
        ```bash
        $ molecule init role <role_name> --driver-name docker
        $ molecule init role my-new-role --driver-name docker
        ```
    - Initializing Molecule within an existing Ansible role,
        ```bash
        $ ansible-galaxy init <role_name>
        $ cd <role_name>
        $ molecule init scenario -r <role_name> --driver-name docker
        ```
- **VERY VERY IMPORTANT** Include explanations about _Configuration blocks_ in `molecule.yml`, `converge.yml` and `verify.yml`.

#### Molecule Commands
All these commands should be run inside the role directory.
- **Testing role with default test matrix**
    - Better suited to test a role once itâ€™s complete rather than in developing phase.
    ```bash
    $ molecule test
    ```
- **Run playbooks in molecule test environment**
    - Converge step allows to re-run the playbook on the test molecule instance without needing to create/destroy the instances every time. This allows to test the role rapidly test the role development workflow to allow for the fastest possible iterations.
    ```bash
    $ molecule converge
    ```
- **Destroy molecule test instance**
    - Tears down an existing molecule test instance already running.
    ```bash
    $ molecule destroy
    ```
- **Run unit testing on playbook run**
    - Enables to run unit tests against molecule test instance.
    ```bash
    $ molecule verify
    ```

- **Log into molecule instance**
    - Manually inspect the molecule test instance during testing.
    ```bash
    $ molecule login
    ```
